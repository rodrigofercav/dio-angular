# `DIO-ANGULAR-COURSE-MANAGER`

### This repository was created to "Angular - Fundamentals" that is a practical course offered by [`DIO`](https://www.dio.me/) in partnership with [`Becas Santander`](https://www.becas-santander.com).
 
### This is an simple application to manage courses, but that is very useful to introduce many Angular basic/mid concepts.

# 
## `UPDATE:`
#### Custom features by myself after course finished:
 - ###### I changed some visual/formatting features
 - ###### I added `Success or Error` messages on forms pages.
 - ###### I added `Create Course` functionality on `Course List` page.
